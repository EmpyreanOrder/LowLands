This folder is used by the World Designer Tool to store some scenes that are used by the tool. 
You can and should delete any "Auto Saved" scenes you find here, so long as they 
are not currently open in the editor. The auto saved scenes should only exist in cases where some kind of operation 
the World Designer tool was attempting to perform fails. In such cases, the auto saved scenes will contain game objects that were not 
managed correctly. You should ensure these objects are not needed or moved to another scene before deleting the auto saved scene they are in.

This folder (and all other folders found in the Editor Default Resources in association with Deep Space Labs) cannot be moved or removed!
