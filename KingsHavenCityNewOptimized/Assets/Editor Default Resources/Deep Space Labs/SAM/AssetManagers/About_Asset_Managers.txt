Asset Managers are Scriptable Object Assets used by the World Designer Tool to manage assets within the Unity Editor. 
You can think of them as Editor versions of Chunk Streamers, however they are more robust as they include functionality 
beyond just loading the assets, like saving and deleting assets. 

Each Asset Manager is linked to a specific Chunk Streamer class. This link is established in a very simple way, 
via the name of the Asset Manager Asset. When the World Designer Tool detects 
that a specific Chunk Streamer is in use by a LOD, it attempts to retrieve the Asset Manager 
Scriptable Asset linked to it. The name of the Asset Manager must follow the format 
'{ChunkStreamerClassName}_AssetManager in order to establish a link, where {ChunkStreamerClassName} is 
replaced by the name of the Chunk Streamer class name.

By default, the World Designer Tool auto-creates default Asset Managers for the 
Scene Chunk Streamer and Prefab Chunk Streamer when no Asset Managers is found in this folder that 
is linked to it. This gives you some default but robust functionality for managing scene 
and prefab assets via the World Designer Tool, however the option is available to you to add or 
change functionality. To do so, simply create a new class that derives from AssetManager and implement 
the functionality that you want. You will then need to create a scriptable object asset from this new class, 
place it in this folder, and name it according to the format described above (PrefabChunkStreamer_AssetManager or 
SceneChunkStreamer_AssetManager). If the Chunk Streamer 
has an existing Asset Manager linked to it, feel free to delete it.

In the future, if you want to go back to using the default Asset Managers for the Prefab Chunk Streamer or Scene Chunk Streamer, 
simply delete or move your custom asset, and the default assets will be auto-created the next time the 
World Designer Tool is used with an LOD making use of the Chunk Streamer in question.

Notice that by default the folder is empty. This ensures that upon future updates to the SAM package, any custom 
Asset Managers you've created will not be overwritten.

This system also allows you to provide functionality for custom Chunk Streamers, which can allow you to work with 
non prefab/scene assets.

Finally, if using Addressables and the Addressable Prefab Chunk Streamer and/or Addressable Scene Chunk Streamer, the SAM package includes 
default Asset Managers, however they cannot be auto-created by the World Designer Tool. You will need to manually generate the 
assets by choosing:

Assets -> Deep Space Labs -> SAM -> Generate Default Addressable Prefab Asset Manager
and/or
Assets -> Deep Space Labs -> SAM -> Generate Default Addressable Scene Asset Manager

This will auto generate the assets in this folder. Of course, you can create custom Asset Managers 
for the Addressable Prefab Chunk Streamer and Addressable Scene Chunk Streamer as well.

This folder (and all other folders found in the Editor Default Resources in association with Deep Space Labs) cannot be moved or removed!
